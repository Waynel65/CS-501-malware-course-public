Pretty sure this is not worthy of extra credit but I still want to say this: 
To download stage2.exe, I managed to understand that a specific user agent string is necessary (i.e. ch0nky) and downloaded the binary manually, instead of blindly running FreeCandty.exe and hoping stage2.exe will appear in the Temp folder.
